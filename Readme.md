# 🧪 A/B Testing Analysis: Mutual Fund Risk Label Impact

This repository contains the full A/B testing analysis project focused on understanding the **impact of visual risk labels** on mutual fund selection behavior. It includes:

- A/B testing design & hypothesis
- Simulated user data (for confidentiality)
- Python analysis notebook
- Visualizations
- PDF report

## 📌 Project Objective

To evaluate whether adding **risk labels** (e.g., 🔴 High Risk, 🟡 Moderate Risk) to mutual funds influences users to:

- Select fewer high-risk funds
- Explore fund details more often
- Sacrifice potential returns in favor of safety

## 📊 A/B Test Setup

| Group       | Description                                     |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| A (Control) | Mutual funds shown with no risk labels          |
| B (Variant) | Mutual funds shown with color-coded risk labels |

Users were asked to select 5 mutual funds for a simulated ₹10 lakh investment portfolio.

### 📈 Key Metrics Analyzed

- % of high-risk funds selected
- Average portfolio return
- Time taken to complete selection
- Click behavior (whether users explored fund details)

## 🧪 Statistical Tests Used

| Test                | Purpose                                                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **T-test**          | Compare average % of high-risk funds selected (A vs B) |
| **T-test**          | Compare average portfolio return                       |
| **Chi-square test** | Analyze categorical difference in click behavior       |

## 🧠 Results Summary

- Users **exposed to risk labels selected significantly fewer high-risk funds**
- These users also had **slightly lower portfolio returns**
- **Click behavior was significantly higher** in the risk label group

These findings suggest risk labels **encourage more cautious and informed decision-making**.
